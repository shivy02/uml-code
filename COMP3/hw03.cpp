Computing III -- COMP.2010 Honor Statement
The practice of good ethical behavior is essential for maintaining
good order in the classroom, providing an enriching learning
experience for students, and as training as a practicing computing
professional upon graduation. This practice is manifested in the
Universityâ€™s Academic Integrity policy. Students are expected to
strictly avoid academic dishonesty and adhere to the Academic
